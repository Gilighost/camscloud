Give a brief explanation of how to use your program. Assume that I already know all the information contained in this document. Suggest test scenarios that demonstrate the the correctness of your program.
Example: Go to the URL http://localhost:8000/files/ and log in using "jane" and "peaches"; you should see a listing of the files in the cloud directory. Now visit the same URL in a second window and click "Log out"; when prompted for a new user name log in using "joe" and "summertime"; you should see the files. Return to the first window and attempt to upload a file. You should get an "unauthorized" message: Joe is not authorized to write!
Give a brief overview of your design: What do I need to know about your project design in order to be able to read your code? How is your code organized? Again, assume I already know all the information contained in this document, and the things we've discussed in class (e.g., project layout).
Explain the helper/partial you made, and why you you chose to implement it as a helperâ€”why might this be useful as a helper?
Explain any weaknesses in your project. These could be things you couldn't get working, things that were necessarily simplified for this project, things that you would do differently if you had more time, etc.
Explain any strengths in your project. Be sure to highlight any way you went beyond the requirements.
Be direct and to the point.
Remember: you are trying to explain your project to me.
